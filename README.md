# Mega-pixel-backend-journey-from-print-to-pain

So... here I am.

This is my journey into backend development — it started with `"print()"` and is now somewhere between *"I got this"* and *"why is it broken again?!"*  
I don’t know much yet, but I ask questions, Google hard, and don’t quit (well, mostly).

## What you'll find here:
- My very first steps with Python  
- Attempts to understand things that probably shouldn’t be this hard  
- Random notes, reflections, and “aha!” moments  
- Comments like `# no idea why this works but it does`  
- And hopefully one day: actual projects with actual logic

## Why I'm doing this:
- Because I’m slightly a masochist, and tech calls me louder than fear  
- I want to learn backend and machine learning, build real projects, and somehow stay human through it all



If this makes you smile — you're welcome to stay
If not, that’s okay too. Keep scrolling, no hard feelings
I’ll be here, wrestling with my next `TypeError`
